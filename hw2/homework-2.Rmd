## Benford's Law

## Education and Income
Proportion of people with less than a college degree earn less than $70,000 income for each borough

#### Bronx
```{r}
prop.table(table(dat_pums_NY$in_Bronx, dat_pums_NY$educ_nohs, dat_pums_NY$income_total <70000))
```

It means that proportion of people without high school degree earns less than $70,000 income in Bronx is 0.0264.
 
We can find the same result by using subset and display it for each borough.

```{r}
dat_use1 <- subset(dat_pums_NY,((income_total < 70000) & educ_nohs))
```

Then use function ddply.

Proportion of people without high school degree earns less than $70,000 income in Staten Island - 0.0062807543, in in Brooklyn - 0.0476023106, in Queens - 0.037399269. 
 
Proportion of people without high school degree earns more than $70,000 income in Bronx, for example - 0.0001426286.
 
Regarding proportion of people with college degree, for example, how have 
Bachelor degree, in Manhattan is 0.006912395 each less than $70,000, and 0.004706745 how 
earn more than $70,000. 


## Income inequality, averages, by neighborhood and borough
This isn't one of your questions, but this boxplot is a nice representation of the inequality by borough.

## Taxi Data
Subsample of the taxi data:
rides paid with credit cards - 193750 rides 
rides paid with cash â€“ 187694 rides

The point estimate:
Sample proportion = (rides paid in cash)/(sample size).
Total number of ride $n = 381444$
Sample proportion = 0.4921

The margin of error: 

$$
c = 0.9 \\
Î± = 1 - c = 0.1 \\
z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}} =  z_{0.05} = 1.645 \\
E = 0.0013
$$

Lower and Upper endpoint:
Lower endpoint $= p\hat = 0.4907$
Upper endpoint = 0.4934
90% confidence interval for the fraction of rides paid in cash on the weekend: 
$0.4907 < p < 0.4934$
