# Data analysis from given data

### 1. Correlations, Hypothesis Tests (20 points)
A recent research paper, looking at how much attractiveness and personal grooming affects wages, used data from The
National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health in 2001-2.

a. Are there gender differences? Among the 6074 people (48.4% female), 38.8% of the males were rated as being well groomed
or very well groomed; 50.6% of the females were rated that way. Is this a statistically significant difference?
b. The study considers interrelations between physical attractiveness and grooming. People were ranked on a 4-point scale
(where 1 is below average, 2 is average, 3 is above average, and 4 is very much above average) for each attribute. The full
details are:

##### Physically

|                               | 4 Very Attractive | 3 Attractive | 2 Average | 1 Less Attractive |
|-------------------------------|-------------------|--------------|-----------|-------------------|
| 4 Very well groomed           | 297               | 199          | 57        | 30
| 3 Well groomed                | 290               | 1169         | 607       | 54
| 2 Average grooming            | 75                | 788          | 2013      | 167
| 1 Less than average grooming  | 1                 | 25           | 164       | 138

c. Conditional on a person being ranked physically 3 or 4 in attractiveness (above average), what is the chance that they are above average (3 or 4) in grooming as well. Conditional on being above average physically, what is the chance that they are average or below average (1 or 2) in grooming? Are these statistically significantly different?
The study also considers the attractiveness of someone's personality (charisma), with the same 4-point scale. These data are:

##### Personality

|                               | 4 Very Attractive | 3 Attractive | 2 Average | 1 Less Attractive |
|-------------------------------|-------------------|--------------|-----------|-------------------|
| 4 Very well groomed           | 326               | 171          | 60        | 26
| 3 Well groomed                | 416               | 1186         | 467       | 51
| 2 Average grooming            | 212               | 966          | 1729      | 136
| 1 Less than average grooming  | 11                | 49           | 184       | 84
         
d. Conditional on having an above-average personality, what is the chance that someone has above-average grooming? Conditional on having an above-average personality, what is the chance that their grooming is at or below average? Is there a statistically significant difference?
e. Comment on the study. If overall attractiveness is a combination of these 3 factors, is there evidence that they are gross substitutes or complements in production?

### Age differences in couples from ACS data
Since there has been a great deal of recent news about age differences in couples, I used the ACS data to look at ages of spouses.

The data are arranged in a particular way: each household answers the survey and picks a person to be "head" then the other (if applicable) as "spouse".  There is no presumption of gender for either role.  In the way I've arranged the data, the line for the person who is labeled "spouse" has some demographics about the household head (all that data is prefixed with h_) so for example here are the first few lines of data:

AGE | h_age | age_diff | SEX    | h_sex  | RELATE
--- | ----- | -------- | ------ | ------ | ------
61  | 56    | 5        | Female | Male   | Spouse
53  | 53    | 0        | Female | Male   | Spouse
61  | 63    | -2       | Female | Male   | Spouse
37  | 35    | 2        | Male   | Female | Spouse
51  | 57    | -6       | Male   | Female | Spouse
34  | 32    | 2        | Male   | Female | Spouse

In the first case the male took role of "head" and female took role of "spouse" so her line of data includes her own age (61) and her husband's age (56) so the "age_diff" is +5. In later lines the female took role of "head" and male took role of "spouse".

You might consider statistics like ``summary(age_diff[(SEX == "Female")&(h_sex == "Male")])``, 
``summary(age_diff[(SEX == "Male")&(h_sex == "Female")])``, ``summary(age_diff[(SEX == "Male")&(h_sex == "Male")])``, and ``summary(age_diff[(SEX == "Female")&(h_sex == "Female")])``.

For each question below, carefully specify the statistical tests that you perform, including the null hypothesis and test statistics such as t-stat and p-value.

1. (10 points) Find some basic summary statistics about the age gap for married people.  How common is a big age gap (you can define "big")?  Can you find some interesting correlates -- is geography a factor? Education? Working status?  Test if the average gap for people over 50 is significantly different from the average gap for people under 50.  Explain what you initially expected to find (before you ran the numbers) and how/if the results shift that view.

2. (15 points) Estimate an OLS model of the age difference.  What are some important variables to include in the regression? Discuss and explain the results; which coefficients are significant? Discuss issues of endogeneity.

3. (20 points) Add your choice of polynomial Age terms along with interactions with dummy variables to the OLS model.  Explain these interaction effects.  Explain the variation with age. Are the interaction coefficients jointly significant - does adding the interaction significantly help in prediction? 

4. (10 points) For a particular subset, I estimate these coefficients for a logit estimation of whether the age difference is especially large.

Varb        | Coeff  | Std Err
----------- | ------ | ---------
educ_hs     | -0.327 | 0.010                   
educ_smcoll | -0.403 | 0.011                   
educ_coll   | -0.615 | 0.011                     
educ_adv    | -0.611 | 0.012   
SEXFemale   | -0.086 | 0.032                  
h_sexFemale | -0.096 | 0.032                
Constant    | -0.369 | 0.033

Explain what these coefficients mean. Should we include education levels of the head as well as the spouse?  Calculate the estimated probability that a spouse with some college, who is male and the head of household is female, has a large age difference.  What is the change in estimated probability if the spouse is female and head of household is male?  What is the change in estimated probability if, instead, the spouse gets an advanced degree?

5. (20 points) Next estimate a logit or probit model, where the dependent variable is now whether the age difference is more than a few years (explain your choice of "a few" and why).  Explain what variables ought to be included or excluded. Discuss the results of the model and hypothesis tests.  Calculate some predicted probabilities for representative people.

6. (20 points) Next estimate another model or several (of your choice) to the age difference.  Explain and discuss - impress me with your econometric virtuosity.  Can you improve some of the predictions of previous models?



### ATUS data
The next questions use the dataset provided, ATUS_for_exam2.RData, (details in file ATUS_for_exam2.R) of just working people (who are coded as "Employed - at work").  You should consider the relevant factors for how much time people spend on social fun activities, ACT_SOCIAL.  This gives minutes of a typical day spent socializing, relaxing, and doing other leisure activities (games, TV, hobbies).   For each question below, carefully specify the statistical tests that you perform, including the null hypothesis and test statistics such as t-stat and p-value.
To get from the ATUS data that I had given in class to this exam data, I ran these simple lines,

```{r eval = FALSE}
load("ATUS_2003_2013_a.RData")
use_varb <- (dat2$EMPSTAT == 'Employed - at work')
dat_use <- subset(dat2,use_varb)
is.na(dat_use$EARNWEEK) <- which((dat_use$EARNWEEK == 9999999))
dat_use$EARNWEEK <- dat_use$EARNWEEK/100
dat_use$lots_social <- (dat_use$ACT_SOCIAL > 180)
```

1. (10 points) Start with some basic statistics: how does the time spent on social activities vary among educational groups? Are these differences statistically significant? Discuss.  (Perhaps relate to opportunity cost.) What other explanatory variables might be relevant?
2. (10 points) There are data items that give the amount of time spent on other activities (time spent working, sleeping, etc) - might there be worries about endogeneity? Explain.  Are there particular correlations that are significant?
3. (15 points) Next estimate a linear OLS model for the dependent variable, time spent on social activities.  Explain what variables you believe are important to include.  Discuss the results.
4. (15 points) The ATUS includes a great number of dummy variables including the state the person lives in (STATEFIP), the metro area (if they are in a metro area, METAREA), their occupation (OCC) and industry (IND).  Add one or more of these factors to your OLS model and discuss how this changes the other estimated coefficients.  Are the dummy variable coefficients jointly significant - does adding the factor significantly help in prediction? 
5. (15 points) Next estimate a logit or probit model, where the dependent variable is now whether the person spends a lot of time (more than 180, so more than 3 hours per day) on social activities.  Explain what variables ought to be included or excluded. Discuss the results of the model and hypothesis tests.
6. (35 points) Next estimate another model or several (of your choice) to predict time spent on social activities.  Explain and discuss - impress me with your econometric virtuosity.  Can you improve some of the predictions of previous models?  

7. (15 points) Using a subset of BRFSS data (so don't bother trying to replicate), I estimated a regression for BMI with the following quadratic terms on age (including an interaction with gender).  [BMI is a person's weight in kg divided by their squared height in m, so a number over 25 is interpreted as overweight.]



### BRFSS Data
1. (15 points) Using a subset of BRFSS data (so don't bother trying to replicate), I estimated a regression for BMI with the following quadratic terms on age (including an interaction with gender).  [BMI is a person's weight in kg divided by their squared height in m, so a number over 25 is interpreted as overweight.]

|                    | Coefficient | Std. Error |
|--------------------|-------------|------------|
| Constant           | 18.968	     | 1.023
| Age	               | 0.523	     | 0.022
| Age2	             | -0.006	     | 0.0003
| Female	           | 1.723	     | 0.605
| Age*Female         | -0.122	     | 0.030
| Age2*Female	       | 0.001	     | 0.0004

  a. Are these coefficient estimates each statistically significant?  Calculate t-statistics and p-values for each (there are 105409 df).
  b. What is the predicted BMI for a 35-year-old male? For a female of the same age? At what age are men predicted to have BMI over 30?  At what age are women predicted to have BMI over 30? 
  c. At what age does male BMI peak?  Female? At what levels for each?
  d. Does this model seem reasonable? Discuss.
  
2. (15 points) Continuing with the BMI data from BRFSS, I estimate a logit model where the dependent variable is whether the person's BMI would classify them as "overweight" or "obese" but again estimate a quadratic in age with gender interaction.  These results are:

|                    | Coefficient | Std. Error |
|--------------------|-------------|------------|
| Constant           | -2.355	     | 0.430
| Age	               | 0.197	     | 0.008
| Age2	             | -0.0020     | 0.0001
| Female	           | 1.360	     | 0.206
| Age*Female         | -0.100	     | 0.010
| Age2*Female	       | 0.0011	     | 0.0001

a. Are these coefficient estimates each statistically significant?  Calculate t-statistics and p-values for each (there are again 105409 df).
b. What is the predicted probability of being overweight for a 35-year-old male? For a female of the same age? 
c. At what age does male probability of being overweight peak?  Female? At what levels for each?
d. Does this model seem reasonable? Discuss.

The next questions use the dataset provided, BRFSS2013_forexam.RData, (details in file brfss_for_exam2.R).  You should make a further examination of factors important in determining whether a person is overweight or obese.  You can decide the best measurement: the data includes a continuous variable (BMI_measure), a 0/1 dummy for overweight (d_overweight), and/or a 4-category classification (X_BMI5CAT).  For each case, carefully specify the statistical tests that you perform, including the null hypothesis and test statistics such as t-stat and p-value.
3. (10 points) Start with some basic statistics: how does the tendency to overweight vary among educational groups? Are these differences statistically significant? Discuss.
4. (10 points) Next estimate a linear model, something like the one in Q 2 above (more extensive of course!).  Explain what variables are important to include?  Discuss the results.
5. (15 points) Next estimate a logit or probit model, something like Q 3 above (more extensive of course!).  Explain what variables ought to be included or excluded. Discuss the results of the model.
6. (35 points) Next estimate another model or several (of your choice) to predict BMI.  Explain and discuss – impress me with your econometric virtuosity.
